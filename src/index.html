    <p class="bio">Graduate student majoring in Information Management at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
       I am very passionate about web development, software engineering and 
       have some experiences in this during my undergrad days.
       I hope to build on those experiences by taking this class and I believe this course will be very helpful for me.
      <br></br>
      I have worked at Deloitte as a Consultant focusing mainly on Cyber Strategy projects 
      within the Risk Advisory domain. I graduated from VIT Vellore in 2021. </p>
